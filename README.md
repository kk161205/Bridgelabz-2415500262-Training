## 💡 About This Repository
This repository captures my **end-to-end learning journey** during the **Bridgelabz Java Training Program**.  
Each week, I explored new aspects of **Java programming**, **OOP principles**, **database integration**, and **real-world project development**.  

The goal was not just to *learn Java syntax*, but to **think like a software engineer** — writing **clean**, **scalable**, and **efficient** code.
